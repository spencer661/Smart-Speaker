# Smart-Speaker With contactless control, smart power management and enhanced user experience.
Our project is done with the ESP32 wrover module.
Our speaker features a DF Player mini-MP3 module which plays MP3 files from a micro-SD card or a USB drive.
It also has a lidar sensor for gesture control. Hand movement away from it plays the previous song and hand gesture close to it plays the next song.
It also features 3 buttons to control the music playing.
It also features a PIR motion sensor which detects motion and if there is no motion after a few minutes turns off the speaker.
It also features an LED cube with synchronises with the music being played.
